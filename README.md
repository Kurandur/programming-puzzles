# Programming Puzzles

🧩 _A collection of creative and efficient solutions (that may be a lie) to popular programming challenges implemented in Rust!_

## 📚 About

This repository contains my Rust implementations of various programming puzzles. Each puzzle demonstrates efficient algorithms and practical Rust coding techniques. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Rust or a puzzle enthusiast, this repo has something for you!

## 🧠 Puzzles

- [⭐ Advent of Code 🎄](src/advent_of_code)  
  _Explore solutions to Advent of Code, a yearly coding challenge filled with creative and festive puzzles._

- [🧬 Rosalind](src/rosalind)  
  _Dive into bioinformatics puzzles from Rosalind, designed to help learn computational biology concepts._

- [🧮 Project Euler](src/project_euler/)  
  _Solve mathematical and algorithmic problems that require more than just programming skills._

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. You can install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Running a Puzzle

To run a specific puzzle solution, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run <puzzle-name>
```

For example, to run a solution for Advent of Code Day 1:

```
cargo run aoc run 2024 1
```

Running All Tests

The repository includes tests (_not many_) to verify the solutions. Run them using:

```bash
cargo test
```
